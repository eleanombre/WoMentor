                -skills: state other skills you have (eg node.js, jinja2)

                [also include icon to link to Twitter (& possibly pre-written tweet, containing the different section headers)]

                Tips:
                What you are seeking could include:
                Career advice (work on CV, interview prep, advice about the industry, etc)
                Technical advice (eg specific questions, teaching code)
                Tag along to networking events
                Provide resources

                We ask that mentors state everything that they can offer, and mentees state the top three things they are looking for -- that way, we can match up mentees with mentors who are best suited for their needs.

                If you have a lot to say, you can split your content into two tweets: just end your tweet with "1/2" or equivalent -->
